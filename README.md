# ar.io Verify

A verification sidecar for [ar.io](https://ar.io) gateways. Runs alongside your gateway and independently proves that data served from Arweave is authentic, untampered, and attributable to a specific owner.

When a user or application asks "is this data real?", the sidecar downloads the raw data from the gateway, reconstructs the cryptographic proof from scratch, and returns a verification result. If the gateway operator has configured a signing wallet, the result is also signed as an attestation — a cryptographic statement from the operator that they personally verified the data.

The verification UI is built into the [ar.io Console](https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-console) at `/verify`, where users can paste a transaction ID and see the full verification report with a downloadable PDF certificate. The sidecar also ships its own standalone web UI at `/verify/` and a REST API for programmatic access.

## How Verification Works

Verification happens in three stages. Each stage builds on the previous one, and the result is assigned a level based on the strongest proof achieved.

### Stage 1 — Existence (Level 1)

The sidecar confirms the transaction exists on the Arweave blockweave by querying the gateway's GraphQL index and checking `/raw/` headers. If the transaction is found in a confirmed block, we know the data was accepted by the network at a specific block height and timestamp.

**What this proves:** the data exists on Arweave and was mined into a block.

### Stage 2 — Data Integrity (Level 2)

The sidecar downloads the full raw data from the gateway and computes its SHA-256 hash independently. This fingerprint can be compared against the gateway's reported digest to confirm consistency.

**What this proves:** the data the gateway served has a known fingerprint. Note that this stage alone does not anchor the hash to anything on-chain — it confirms the gateway served consistent bytes, but the real integrity guarantee comes from Stage 3.

### Stage 3 — Signature Verification (Level 3)

The sidecar reconstructs the exact message that the original signer signed (the "deep hash") from the transaction's constituent parts — owner, target, tags, and data. It then verifies the cryptographic signature against that message using the appropriate algorithm:

- **RSA-PSS** (type 1) — Arweave native wallets
- **ED25519** (type 2) — Solana wallets
- **ECDSA secp256k1** (type 3) — Ethereum wallets

For bundled data items (ANS-104), the sidecar fetches the binary header from the root bundle via a range request to get the exact original tag bytes, since re-encoded tags from GraphQL can differ from the signed original.

**What this proves:** the stated owner cryptographically signed this exact data. The data is authentic and has not been modified since signing. This is a mathematical proof, not a trust claim.

### Quick Reference

| Level | Name                | What it proves                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | Verified            | Digital signature confirmed — data is authentic and untampered |
| 2     | Partially Verified  | Data fingerprint confirmed, signature could not be checked     |
| 1     | Existence Confirmed | Data found on the network, full verification not yet possible  |

### Operator Attestation

When a gateway operator configures their Arweave wallet (`WALLET_FILE`), the sidecar signs the verification result with the operator's private key. This creates an attestation — a statement from a known operator on the ar.io network that they independently verified the data. Anyone can check this attestation by verifying the RSA-PSS signature against the operator's public key.

Attestation data is included in the JSON API response, the PDF certificate, and is available via a dedicated `/attestation` endpoint for programmatic verification.

## ar.io Console Integration

The primary way most users interact with verification is through the [ar.io Console](https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-console), which embeds the verify feature at `/verify`. The Console points to this sidecar's API as its backend — when a user verifies a transaction in the Console, the request flows to this service.

The sidecar also ships its own standalone React web UI (served at `/verify/` on the sidecar's port) for direct access without the Console. Both UIs use the same API.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ar-io/ar-io-verify.git
cd ar-io-verify
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Deployment

Runs as a sidecar alongside an ar.io gateway on the same Docker network (`ar-io-network`).

```bash
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env   # edit GATEWAY_URL, WALLET_FILE, GATEWAY_HOST
bash start.sh
```

Results are cached in SQLite, so repeated lookups for the same transaction return instantly.

## Architecture

```
packages/
  server/    Express API — verification pipeline, PDF certificates, SQLite cache
  web/       React frontend — Vite, Tailwind CSS, served at /verify/
deploy/      Docker Compose + nginx reverse proxy
```

### Verification Pipeline

```
1. HEAD /raw/{txId} + GraphQL    — parallel (~50ms)
2. Determine L1 tx vs data item
3. Download raw data + binary header fetch (range request)
4. Deep hash reconstruction → signature verify (RSA-PSS / ED25519 / ECDSA)
5. Operator attestation (if wallet configured)
```

### Attestation Format

When `WALLET_FILE` is set, the operator's wallet signs a canonical attestation payload:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "txId": "...",
  "dataHash": "...",
  "signatureVerified": true,
  "ownerAddress": "...",
  "blockHeight": 888672,
  "operator": "7p90oVDW...",
  "gateway": "vilenarios.com",
  "attestedAt": "2026-04-08T..."
}
```

To verify: pass the canonical JSON (keys sorted alphabetically, no whitespace) to a standard RSA-PSS SHA-256 verifier with the operator's public key.
